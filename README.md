# 🌱 Smart Plant Pot

A 3D-printed smart plant pot that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture and alerts when the water reservoir is empty.

## 🧠 Features
- Detects soil moisture using a capacitive sensor.
- Turns on a mini water pump when soil is dry.
- Checks water level in the reservoir and lights up an LED when empty.
- 3D printed pot with integrated water reservoir.

## ⚙️ Components
- Arduino Nano / Uno
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
- Water Level Sensor / Float Sensor
- Mini Submersible Pump (5V)
- LED + Resistor
- Transistor
- Diode
- Power Source 

## 🧩 Working
1. Soil moisture sensor checks dryness.
2. Pump activates when soil is dry and reservoir has water.
3. LED glows when reservoir is empty.
